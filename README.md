This repository contains the development of the final degree project titled "Detection of Modified Images or Videos using Neural Networks" for the Computer Engineering degree at the Autonomous University of Barcelona.

The project focuses on the application of neural networks for detecting and identifying modified images or videos. It explores the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze and classify visual data based on the presence of modifications. The goal is to develop a robust and accurate model that can differentiate between authentic and manipulated images or videos.

## Neural Network Architecture üèóÔ∏è
The neural network architecture consists of the following layers:

- Input layer that receives RGB images of size 128x128 pixels.
- Two convolutional layers with 32 filters each, using the ReLU activation function.
- MaxPooling layer to reduce spatial dimension.
- Dropout layer to prevent overfitting.
- Two additional sets of convolutional and MaxPooling layers with 128 filters each.
- Flatten layer to convert the output into a one-dimensional vector.
- Fully connected layer with 512 neurons and ReLU activation function.
- Dropout layer to further prevent overfitting.
- Output layer with 2 neurons and softmax activation function for classifying authentic or manipulated images.

The structure of the neural network is designed to effectively process and extract features from images. It follows the following principles:

- Convolutional layers detect local features.
- MaxPooling layers reduce spatial dimensions.
- Dense layers capture high-level relationships in the data.
- Dropout regularization improves model generalization.
- Softmax activation in the output layer allows for classification.

This architecture enables the model to effectively classify and identify whether an input image has been modified, as well as identify the area of modification.

## Brief Explanation of Model Operation üòÉ

The following provides a brief explanation of the process for classifying an initial image using the model and determining if it has been modified, while also identifying the area of modification.

1. **Image Preprocessing**
   - Our input is an RGB image that requires preprocessing before passing it to the model for analysis.
   - The first step is resizing the image to a specific size, typically the size the model was trained on, such as a 128x128 pixel image.
   - Next, we apply the Error Level Analysis (ELA) algorithm to enhance the image's features.

2. **Image Transformation**
   - To improve the model's performance, we convert the processed image into a matrix before feeding it to the model for classification.
   - This matrix is then used as input for the classification model.

3. **Model Classification and Output**
   - The model performs the classification on the image and returns a vector with two values.
   - These values represent the prediction percentages for two existing classes: authentic or manipulated.
   - The model's output provides an indication of the likelihood that the image belongs to either class.

4. **Result Visualization**
   - For visualization purposes, a function is applied that utilizes one of the layers generated by the model during feature extraction.
   - A heat map is applied to the image, highlighting the identified area of modification.
   - Finally, the resulting image, emphasizing the identified area of modification, is displayed.

This process enables the classification of an initial image, determination of potential modifications, and identification of the modified area using preprocessing techniques, model classification, and result visualization.
