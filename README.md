## Overview

The main objective of this project is the development of a system for detecting modified images or videos using neural networks. This system can be used to identify tampered media, which is an important task in fields such as digital forensics, journalism, and social media analysis.

The system is developed using Python and TensorFlow, and it is based on state-of-the-art deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks.

## Repository structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `src/`: contains the source code of the system, including the neural network models and the pre-processing and post-processing modules.
- `data/`: contains the input and output data used for training and testing the neural network models.
- `docs/`: contains the documentation of the project, including the report, slides, and user manual.
- `tests/`: contains the testing scripts and results for the system.

## Getting started

To run the system, you need to install Python 3 and TensorFlow. You can use the following commands to install the required packages:
pip install tensorflow

Once you have installed the required packages, you can run the system by running the following command:
python src/main.py


For more detailed instructions on how to install and run the system, please refer to the user manual in the `docs/` directory.
